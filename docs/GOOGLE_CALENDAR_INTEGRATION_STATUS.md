# Google Calendar Integration - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Added Missing Test Endpoints
**Issue:** `/api/google-calendar/test-connection` endpoint was being called but didn't exist, returning HTML home page instead of API response.

**Solution:** 
- ‚úÖ Created `/api/google-calendar/test-connection` endpoint in `server/routes.ts` (line 2244-2265)
- ‚úÖ This endpoint is an alias to the test functionality for backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ The original `/api/google-calendar/test` endpoint also exists and works (line 2226-2241)

### 2. Fixed storage.getUserById Error
**Issue:** Audit logger was throwing errors because `storage.getUserById` method didn't exist.

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Added `getUserById` method to IStorage interface in `server/storage.ts` (line 198)
- ‚úÖ Implemented `getUserById` method in DatabaseStorage class (lines 783-785)
- ‚úÖ The method is an alias that calls the existing `getUser` method

### 3. Verified Google Calendar Endpoints
All three main endpoints are now working correctly:

1. **`/api/google-calendar/test-connection`** (NEW)
   - Tests connection to Google Calendar API
   - Returns list of available calendars
   - Attempts to find Building Knowledge calendar

2. **`/api/google-calendar/test`** (EXISTING)
   - Primary test endpoint with same functionality
   - Returns connection status and calendar list

3. **`/api/google-events`** (EXISTING)
   - Fetches events from Building Knowledge calendar
   - Supports date range parameters
   - Has `forceSync` option to bypass cache

## üîß Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`server/routes.ts`**
   - Added `/api/google-calendar/test-connection` endpoint (lines 2244-2265)
   - Both test endpoints call `extendedService.testConnection()` from googleCalendarService

2. **`server/storage.ts`**
   - Added `getUserById` to IStorage interface (line 198)
   - Implemented `getUserById` in DatabaseStorage class (lines 783-785)

### Authentication Requirements
- All Google Calendar endpoints require authentication
- Admin role is required for test endpoints (`requireRole('admin')`)
- Regular authentication is required for `/api/google-events`

## üìù Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Browser Testing (Recommended)

1. **Login as admin:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/dev-login/test-admin
   ```

2. **Test the endpoints:**
   - Test Connection: `http://localhost:5000/api/google-calendar/test-connection`
   - Test (Primary): `http://localhost:5000/api/google-calendar/test`
   - Get Events: `http://localhost:5000/api/google-events?startDate=2025-10-27T00:00:00Z&endDate=2025-11-03T00:00:00Z&forceSync=true`

### Method 2: Test Scripts

Two test scripts have been created:
1. **`scripts/test-google-calendar.mjs`** - Basic endpoint testing
2. **`scripts/test-calendar-with-auth.mjs`** - Full authentication flow testing
3. **`scripts/test-calendar-curl.sh`** - Shell script using curl

Run: `node scripts/test-google-calendar.mjs`

### Method 3: Manual curl Testing

```bash
# 1. Login and get session (note the redirect)
curl -c cookies.txt http://localhost:5000/api/dev-login/test-admin

# 2. Test connection endpoint
curl -b cookies.txt http://localhost:5000/api/google-calendar/test-connection

# 3. Get events
curl -b cookies.txt "http://localhost:5000/api/google-events?startDate=2025-10-27T00:00:00Z&endDate=2025-11-03T00:00:00Z"
```

## üéØ Expected Responses

### Successful Test Connection Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully connected to Google Calendar",
  "calendars": [
    { "id": "calendar_id_1", "name": "Calendar Name 1" },
    { "id": "calendar_id_2", "name": "Calendar Name 2" }
  ],
  "buildingKnowledgeCalendar": "calendar_id_if_found"
}
```

### Successful Events Fetch Response
```json
[
  {
    "id": "event_id",
    "summary": "Event Title",
    "description": "Event Description",
    "startTime": "2025-10-27T10:00:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2025-10-27T11:00:00.000Z",
    "calendarId": "calendar_id",
    "location": "Event Location"
  }
]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Notes

### Building Knowledge Calendar
The system looks for a calendar named "Building Knowledge" by default. This can be configured:

1. **Environment Variable:** Set `BUILDING_KNOWLEDGE_CALENDAR_NAME` to change the calendar name
2. **Fallback Logic:** If not found, the system will look for calendars containing "bki", "building", or "knowledge"
3. **Primary Calendar:** Falls back to primary calendar if Building Knowledge calendar not found

### Google Calendar API Requirements
- Google Calendar API must be enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Service account or OAuth credentials must be configured
- The integration uses the `googleapis` npm package

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] `/api/google-calendar/test-connection` endpoint created and responds
- [x] `/api/google-calendar/test` endpoint exists and works
- [x] `/api/google-events` endpoint fetches events with date range
- [x] `getUserById` method added to storage.ts
- [x] Audit logger no longer throws errors
- [x] All endpoints return 401 when not authenticated (expected behavior)
- [x] All endpoints work when authenticated as admin

## üöÄ Status: COMPLETE

All requested features have been successfully implemented:
1. ‚úÖ Test endpoints are now available
2. ‚úÖ Google Calendar connection can be verified
3. ‚úÖ Events can be fetched from Building Knowledge calendar
4. ‚úÖ Storage.getUserById error has been fixed

The Google Calendar integration is now fully functional and ready for use.
