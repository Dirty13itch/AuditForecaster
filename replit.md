# Energy Auditing Field Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack energy auditing field application for field inspectors to manage inspections, track jobs, schedule events, and generate reports. It emphasizes outdoor readability, offline-first functionality, and rapid data entry. The application aims to streamline energy auditing workflows, improve data accuracy through photo documentation and OCR, and provide robust analytics for job and builder performance. Its business vision includes transforming field operations with a comprehensive, user-friendly, and powerful mobile solution for energy auditing.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, using **Vite** for fast development. **Wouter** handles client-side routing. UI components leverage **shadcn/ui** (based on Radix UI) and are styled with **Tailwind CSS**, following a "New York" style variant with neutral base colors and a custom color system optimized for outdoor readability. **TanStack Query** manages server state, while local component state uses React hooks. For offline support, a **Service Worker** caches assets, **IndexedDB** stores persistent data, and a custom sync queue handles mutations during offline periods. The design system emphasizes readability and mobile usability with specific font choices (Roboto, Open Sans), minimum font sizes, and touch target dimensions.

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses **Express.js** with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**. **PostgreSQL** (via Neon serverless) is the primary database, accessed through **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe queries. API architecture is RESTful, with routes defined in `server/routes.ts` and data access abstracted via `server/storage.ts`. **Zod** schemas are used for request/response validation. **Passport.js** with a local strategy, **Bcrypt** for password hashing, and **Express sessions** with a PostgreSQL-backed store handle authentication and session management.

### Data Model

The core entities include **Users**, **Builders**, **Jobs**, **Schedule Events**, **Expenses**, **Mileage Logs**, **Photos**, **Report Templates**, **Report Instances**, **Forecasts**, **Calendar Preferences**, and **Google Events**. Key relationships link Jobs to Builders, Schedule Events, Photos, and Expenses, while Report Instances are generated from Templates for specific Jobs. Calendar Preferences store per-user toggle states for each Google Calendar. Google Events maintain a separate table for non-job-linked calendar events with an isConverted flag to track conversion history.

### Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications

- **Comprehensive Error Prevention:** Includes centralized logging (Winston on server, console on client), extensive type safety (elimination of 'any'), loading states for mutations, null/undefined guards using `??` and type-guarded filters, thorough API error handling with try-catch blocks, and a two-layer Error Boundary system for UI resilience.
- **Input Validation:** Zod schemas are used for both API endpoint validation and form component validation (e.g., DynamicForm, BuilderDialog).
- **Bulk Operations:** Multi-select functionality across Photos, Jobs, and Expenses with shared infrastructure (`useBulkSelection` hook, `SelectionToolbar`, `BulkActionDialogs`). Supports bulk delete (200-item limit), bulk export to CSV/JSON (1000-item limit), and bulk tag management for photos (add/remove/replace modes). Accounting-friendly CSV exports include enriched metadata (job names, builder details) for financial reporting.
- **Search & Filtering:** Advanced search across Jobs (name, address, builder, status), Builders (name, company, specialization), and Photos (tags, job, date range) with real-time filtering and pagination support.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Provides metrics on inspection volume, photo tag analysis, inspection status breakdown, and common issues tracking. Features include forecast accuracy tracking (TDL and DLO), builder performance comparison with metrics like completion rate and forecast accuracy, and trend analysis for common failed inspection items. **Date Range Filtering:** Custom DateRangePicker component with preset ranges (Today, Last 7/30 days, This/Last month, Last 3/6 months, This year, Custom) and dual calendar selection for custom dates. All analytics metrics dynamically filter by selected range with localStorage persistence to remember user preferences.
- **PDF Export System:** Uses `@react-pdf/renderer` for professional, multi-section PDF generation with dynamic pagination, photo grids (with tags and annotations), and intelligent form fields. Generated PDFs are uploaded to private object storage.
- **Photo Documentation:** Supports multi-tag systems, annotations (arrows, text, measurements via `react-konva`), and **OCR text extraction** using `tesseract.js` for auto-filling job fields. Includes photo-required checklist items.
- **Dual Photo Capture System:** Comprehensive photo capture with native gallery selection (primary) and in-app web camera (secondary). **GalleryPhotoPicker** provides native file input with multi-select, smart date filtering (today/last 7 days/all photos), thumbnail preview grid before upload, batch upload with individual progress tracking, and filename+hash-based duplicate detection with "Skip duplicates" option. **EnhancedWebCamera** uses ImageCapture API for 12MP max resolution (4096x3072), improved compression (0.92 quality, 2560px max, 1MB target), real-time preview, 3-second countdown timer, and SHA-256 hash-based duplicate detection. **PhotoCapture** unified interface offers both methods with appropriate UI hierarchy. Features include: context-aware auto-linking to current job, offline queue support via IndexedDB sync queue (queues metadata creation when offline), SHA-256 content hashing for cross-session duplicate detection (both components), visual duplicate badges and warnings, automatic compression and upload to Replit Object Storage, and cache invalidation on completion. **Note:** Duplicate detection resets on server restart due to MemStorage architecture; moving to persistent PostgreSQL will maintain hashes across restarts.
- **Offline-First Functionality:** Leverages service workers, IndexedDB, and a custom sync queue for robust operation without internet connectivity.
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Comprehensive multi-calendar integration with CalendarLayersPanel sidebar showing all user calendars with color indicators and toggle checkboxes (matching Google Calendar UI). Fetches events from multiple enabled calendars with automatic sync every 10 minutes (configurable via VITE_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS), syncs on page visibility change, and includes offline detection. Visual distinction between job-linked events (colored by status, ðŸ”— icon) and Google-only events (gray with ðŸ“… icon, dashed border). One-click event-to-job conversion with ConvertGoogleEventDialog that pre-fills job data from event metadata (titleâ†’name, locationâ†’address, descriptionâ†’notes). Sync status indicators show real-time state (Syncing/Synced/Error/Offline) with automatic timeout cleanup. Calendar preferences persist toggle states in storage. Error resilience with sequential calendar fetching and partial-sync tolerance. GoogleEvent schema maintains audit trail with isConverted flag.
- **Conditional Logic:** Dynamic inspection forms are driven by a conditional logic engine.
